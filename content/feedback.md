I've been thinking about feedback and how it can be a powerful tool for growth and improvement. I've realized that feedback is not just about pointing out mistakes or shortcomings, but also about sharing insights and perspectives that can help others learn and develop. I've also learned that feedback is not just about giving feedback, but also about receiving feedback and being open to it.

## When does feedback come hand in hand?

- Situations
    - Team member, you don’t get along with?
    - Hierarchy changes that are affecting you?
    - Not able to voice your opinion because some colleagues cut you off?

## What’s the intent of giving feedback?

Make things better, for you and the team. Defining and communicating your boundaries and working style.

By giving the information on what happened and what would be your expectation in similar future situations, you’re building, hopefully, a professional and trustworthy relationship with your team.

## Some general guidelines

- Be as precise as you can, **talk about a specific situation**, and avoid generic assumptions like “you always do this or that… “
- The **feedback should not be directed at the person** but to the thing/situation, as the intent is to make the situation better.
- **Avoid assumptions** about what this person thought (you can never know their intention), and instead focus on what you observed.
- **Don’t wait too long to give feedback**, my rule of thumbs here is to wait until I have already processed my emotions and thoughts about the situation, which can varey, but most of the time its around 1 day, and then start working on the feedback to deliver, waiting on something for weeks would feel unrelvenat and could open a debate of what really happened which better to avoid.
- **1:1 Feedback,** most of us are less defensive in a 1:1 setting; however, if something happened in a public setting (someone cut you off in the daily and you called them out), delivering a 1:1 will also need an extra public apology/feedback with people who were included.

## How to prepare?

- **Write down the feedback,** and explain the situation, it helps spot points you’re making assumptions, and helps see through the situation. (You don’t need to share the feedback while delivering it, but you can ask for a second opinion from another colleague or your manager.)
- **Vulnerability**: Being vulnerable about how the situation made you feel builds trust and understanding from the other side. You don’t need to be uncomfortable, but also don’t hide what the situation is doing to you.
- **Define the change you'd like to see.** For example, if a colleague re-implements your code without discussing bugs or reasons for the changes, you would like to establish two-way communication before similar actions occur in the future.

## What if you deliver feedback that doesn't go well?

I believe giving less well-structured feedback is also part of the learning process and building relationships with your teammates. My suggestion here is that if you delivered feedback —regardless of how it was initially received—take responsibility. Schedule a follow-up meeting to acknowledge your change in perspective and explain what made you change your mind.
