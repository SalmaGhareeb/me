Hi, I’m Salma — a software engineer based in Berlin with a focus on building reliable systems and clear communication. I’ve spent the last few years working mostly in backend development with Go.

This site is a mix of things I’m learning, experimenting with, or reflecting on — from tech topics and architecture ideas to notes on collaboration and personal growth. I’m especially interested in simplifying complex problems, writing code that’s easy to reason about, and navigating the human side of engineering.

Thanks for stopping by.

— Salma
